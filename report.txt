Each group member must also write an individual report about how the group worked on the assignment. You should say how your group decided to divide the work up, and what your own contribution was. Feel free to discuss any lessons you learned about working in groups! This report can be very brief â€“ it doesn't need to be longer than a page.
Your individual report must include your name and the names of other group members.
